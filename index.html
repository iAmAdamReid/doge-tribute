  <p>"Doge" is an internet meme that spawned somewhere between the years 2010 and 2013. The classic format consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog breed accompanied by different words in multi-colored "comic sans" font. The word content is usually intended as an internal monologue, often presented in the form of intentionally broken english.</p>
  
  <p>From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)#Structure' target='_blank'>Wikipedia:</a></p>
<p class='quote'>Doge uses two-word phrases in which the first word is almost always one of five modifiers ("so", "such", "many", "much", and "very"), and the departure from correct English is to use the modifier with a word that it cannot properly modify.[3] For example, "Much respect. So noble." uses the doge modifiers but is not "proper" doge because the modifiers are used in a formally correct fashion; the doge version would be "Much noble, so respect."[3] In addition to these phrases, a doge utterance often ends with a single word, most often "wow" but with "amaze" and "excite" also being used.[3]</p>

  <p class='center small-text'>A classic doge meme.</p>
  
  <p>The popularity of doge is widespread, and it has become one of the most recognizable memes on the entire internet. The doge meme was the inspiration for the <a href='http://dogecoin.com/' target='_blank'>cryptocurrency "DogeCoin"</a>, which is a reappropriation of the original Bitcoin Core hashing algorithm. There is a version of the puzzle game "2048" known as <a href='http://doge2048.com/' target='_blank'>Doge2048</a> that has various interpretations of the doge meme included.</p>
  
  <p>The ubiquity of doge is a subject of discernment among meme enthusiasts, with much analysis given to the virality and staying-power of the doge meme. Many questions arise: how and why was a Shiba Inu chosen? What gives the broken English its memetic charm? Why use Comic Sans?</p>
    
  <p>Some personal speculations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why Shiba Inu?</li>
        The Shiba Inu is an exotic breed for Western audiences, and the particular "genesis meme" shows a Shiba Inu with a particularly anthropomorphic expression, allowing for emotional recognition and familiarity for human audiences. Additionally, the novelty aspect for audiences unfamiliar with the Shiba Inu breed gives appeal and distinction from more familiar Western breeds like the Golden Retriever or German Shepherd.
        <li>Why broken English?</li>
      Seeing the text as an "internal doggie monologue" gives credence and believability that perhaps, if dogs or doges could speak, their expression of English would be "dogified", and grammatically incomplete. 
      <li>Why Comic Sans?</li>
      Comic Sans is considered a <em>faux pas</em> in internet design due to its perceived childishness and amateur quality. This aligns well with the seemingly childish and good-natured quality of most dogs, who have a particular innocence with regards to how we perceive them to experience reality. Whether or not dogs do experience life in this way is up for debate, but our perception of them leads us to believe it is so.
  </ul>
  
  <p>Doge's catapult to the upper echelons of the memetic hierarchy gives ample opportunity for analysis as to what makes a meme a meme. In just our simple analysis above, we can determine that high-quality or "dank" memes have: emotional familiarity, linguistic contextualization, rapidity of transference, and cross-cultural appeal. This study of "meme-ology" differs from the study of "memetics" in that memeology is domain-specific to the Internet, while memetics is applicable to multiple domains of information. Therefore, memeology falls under the purview of memetics, but is a more specialized field of study.</p>

  <p>We hope you have enjoyed our analysis and tribute to the Doge today, and that perhaps you have learned more about the meme and its invocations, as well as the broader field of memeology as a whole. Until next time, safe travels and happy memeing!</p>
